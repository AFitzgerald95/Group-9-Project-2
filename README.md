# Description

Our motivation for making this project was to make an application to log all of the media a person consumes.
We did this because we have heard people address the desires to share the different books or shows they have completed with other people.  This was a goal to start a program to track them to be able to show others.  
This solves the inevitable issue of not being able to remember EVERY different thing, or even having a read made list in general.  
The biggest thing we learned was how to work better in a team.  We also had a lot of learning to do with Heroku itself.  

# Installation

The installation on this project started originally by assigning roles to each individual to work on, or to research if they were not aware of how to create that piece.  Then we had one person make the general back end model data as well as the seeds.  Another individual worked on the connections and the server files themselves.  While all of this was happening, we had some members working on the front end work on Handlebars and the CSS.  Then we had a lot of errors to troubleshoot. We spent the rest of our time correcting the errors that occurred will working separately.

# Usage

This application has the future use of being a small social media platform people can use to log their media.  This is much like logging books on GoodReads, or logging your movies on Moviebase.  This would be condensed down to a single location as well as the future ability of being able to share with others.
